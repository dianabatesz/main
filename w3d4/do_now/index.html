		<h1> Why Kelly Peloquin is MY IDOL </h1>
	</div>
	<p id="agpara"> Kelly grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, and at a very young age developed a passion for swimming. As a member of North Baltimore Aquatic Club, home to many past and present Olympians, she achieved a National Age Group Record and Senior National time standards. Kelly also swam for McDonogh High School and helped her team win the state championships while recieving All American status for four consecutive years.
 	<br>
 	<br>
	She earned an athletic scholarship to the University of Miami in Florida and graduated with a degree in Sport Administration and Business. Along with participation in collegiate athletics, Kelly spent summers coaching and developed an interest in non-profit organizations. Over the course of her Senior year in college and upon graduation she worked for several foundations including: Alonzo Mourning Charities, H20s Foundation, and The John Taylor Babbitt Foundation.  
 	<br>
 	<br>
	Kelly recently joined AGUA after serving as the Head Aquatic Coach of two Lifetime Fitness facilities in North New Jersey. While at Lifetime, Kelly coached Masters and help successfully build membership working with two Age Group programs. She arranged meets, social events, and guided them to a competitive arena.
 	<br>
 	<br>
	She enjoys working with athletes and having the ability to provide them with tools necessary to succeed in both their sport and as individuals in life. Through her experiences working with non-profit organizations, she is able to understand the importance of community and the development of youth. Kelly is looking forward to working with AGUA in an atmosphere that embodies all aspects of youth development: social, academic, and physical through aquatic education. </p>
